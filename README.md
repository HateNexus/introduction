# Hate Nexus
Our mission is to foster an inclusive community of volunteers who collaborate
on projects that deal with online hate speech.

## Who are we?
We hail from various corners of the globe but most of us either studied at
National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan or The University of the 
West Indies in Trinidad & Tobago. Most of us have a Computer Science
background but we welcome anyone who would like to work with us, regardless
of tech experience.

## Origin
The idea for this was born from research done at the 
[IDEA](https://github.com/IDEA-NTHU-Taiwan) at National Tsing Hua University. 
Since then, we've expanded with other volunteers.

## What do we do?
Our first major project will be an interactive repository of 
hate speech data, with a focus on hate speech code words. Overtime we will add 
more projects and raw datasets to this space.

## Principles
We believe in equality and fair treatment for all but due to the nature of hate 
speech, content in the repositories might be explicit and offensive
to some. Any such material found here is intended only for illustrative purposes
or for use in our projects.

We do not believe that hate speech is defined by vocabulary, but rather by intent.
Hateful language can come with or without the presence of specific words. Context
is important.

Most of our work and processes is open source and available for you to do with as
you please. We only ask that you provide attribution or consider contributing to our 
projects if you find our work useful.
